title: Week 04, 2026 – Infrastructure Takes a Breather
---

Compute's five-week leadership streak ended abruptly. After dominating since mid-December, the layer posted its worst week since the October selloff while Application and Platform both recovered modestly. Application claimed weekly leadership for the first time in 2026.

The reversal was sharp — the largest swing between Compute and Application since early January's rotation began. But context matters: Compute still leads year-to-date by a wide margin. The January infrastructure trade isn't unwinding, it's pausing.

The concentration pattern persisted even as leadership changed. A handful of names at the top posted gains while the broader index lost ground — the fourth consecutive week of this divergence. The market remains narrow.

Bubble readings continue to climb, with Application now showing the highest pressure of any layer. What's notable: Application's speculative signals are rising even as its prices stabilize. The selloff hasn't fully reset expectations — multiples are compressing slower than prices fell.

Our analysis from three weeks ago argued that bubble critics were looking at the wrong layer — that risk lived in Application and Platform expectations, not Compute infrastructure. That thesis still holds. Compute remains the healthiest layer by our measures, while Application shows the most elevated readings. But Application's rising speculative pressure despite falling prices is worth watching: if expectations don't reset alongside valuations, that's where stress could build.
