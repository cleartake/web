title: Week 04, 2026 – Infrastructure Takes a Breather
---

Compute's five-week leadership streak ended abruptly. After dominating since mid-December, the layer dropped 1.9% this week — its worst performance since the October selloff. Application and Platform both posted modest gains, with Application edging ahead at +0.5% to claim weekly leadership for the first time in 2026.
The reversal was sharp. Last week Compute led by 3.4 percentage points; this week it trailed by 2.3 points. That's a 5.7 point swing in the Compute-Application spread, the largest week-over-week shift since early January's rotation began.

Despite the pullback, Compute still leads year-to-date at +5.3%. But the gap is narrowing — Platform sits at -3.2% and Application at -5.7%, both improving from last week's lows. The January infrastructure trade isn't unwinding, but it's no longer accelerating.

The concentration pattern persisted even as leadership changed. The top 5 contributors again posted gains (+0.29%) while the rest of the index lost ground (-0.67%), marking the fourth consecutive week of this divergence. The aggregate index fell 0.4%, its third down week in four.

Bubble readings continue to climb. The aggregate reached 0.41 — solidly in warming territory and approaching the 0.50 threshold that would signal elevated conditions. Application now shows the highest reading at 0.45, driven by valuation acceleration of 0.73 — the highest of any layer and up sharply from 0.62 last week. This is notable: Application's bubble score is rising even as its prices stabilize, suggesting multiple compression hasn't kept pace with the fundamental reset.

One week doesn't make a trend reversal. But after five weeks of uninterrupted Compute dominance, the market is at least pausing to reassess. Whether this is a brief consolidation before infrastructure resumes leadership or the beginning of a broader rotation back toward software remains to be seen.
