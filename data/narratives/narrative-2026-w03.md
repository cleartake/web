title: Week 03, 2026 – Compute Makes It Five in a Row
---

The infrastructure rotation is no longer a rotation — it's a trend. Compute gained another 1.1% while Platform and Application both fell, extending Compute's leadership streak to five consecutive weeks. This is the longest sustained layer divergence since the index began tracking in early 2025.

Application took the hardest hit this week, dropping 2.3% — its steepest weekly decline since the October selloff. Platform continued its slow bleed, down 0.7%. The year-to-date picture is now stark: Compute has climbed 7.3% while Platform has lost 3.5% and Application has fallen 6.2%. That's a 13.5 percentage point gap between the best and worst performing layers in just three weeks.

The concentration pattern persists. For the third consecutive week, the top 5 contributors posted gains while the remaining 45 companies lost ground. This week the top 5 added 0.53% while the rest subtracted 1.07%, dragging the aggregate index down 0.5% despite strength at the top. Leadership and the broader market continue moving in opposite directions.
Bubble readings ticked higher across all layers. The aggregate now sits at 0.40 — the upper end of warming territory. Compute rose to 0.36 (still normal), Platform to 0.43 (warming), and Application to 0.41 (warming). Valuation acceleration is climbing everywhere, with Application showing the highest reading at 0.62 — expectations continue to run ahead even as prices decline. The divergence between falling prices and rising valuation acceleration in Application suggests the selloff hasn't yet compressed multiples enough to reset sentiment.

The story remains the same as previous week — capital rotating back toward infrastructure — but the persistence is notable. Five weeks of unbroken Compute leadership, three weeks of top-heavy concentration, and widening YTD gaps between layers. Whether this reflects structural repricing of the AI stack or simply Application profit-taking that's run longer than expected, the market continues to vote for picks and shovels over productivity software.
