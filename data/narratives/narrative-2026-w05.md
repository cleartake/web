---

All three layers fell together for the first time since October. The aggregate index dropped 2.6% — the seventh-largest weekly decline on record and the worst since the December drawdown. Application led the selloff, followed closely by Compute, with Platform holding up relatively better but still firmly negative.

This wasn't a rotation — it was a broad risk-off move. The layer divergences that defined January collapsed into synchronized selling. Application, which briefly took leadership last week, gave back those gains and more. Compute, which dominated the first three weeks of the year, has now posted back-to-back declines and surrendered most of its January outperformance.

The year-to-date picture has shifted dramatically. Compute still leads but its cushion has shrunk to just 2%. Platform sits nearly 5% lower. Application, which started the year as the strongest layer, is now down almost 9% — the sharpest January decline of any layer.

The concentration pattern finally broke. For the first four weeks of January, the top 5 contributors posted gains while the rest of the index fell. This week, the selloff was broad enough that even the top 5 barely held positive while the remaining 45 companies drove nearly all of the decline.

Bubble readings eased across the board — the natural consequence of falling prices compressing multiples. The aggregate dropped from 0.41 to 0.38, back toward the middle of the warming range. Application's valuation acceleration declined notably, suggesting expectations are starting to reset alongside prices.

Our analysis from four weeks ago argued that bubble critics were looking at the wrong layer — that risk lived in Application and Platform expectations, not Compute infrastructure. That thesis still holds. Compute remains the healthiest layer by our measures even after two down weeks. But the January selloff is testing whether the Application reset is orderly or the start of something deeper.
