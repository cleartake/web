title: Week 01, 2026 — Capital Rotated Back to Compute
---

The AI value chain split sharply. Compute jumped nearly 4% while Platform and Application both fell more than 2% — the widest layer divergence since early April. This wasn't a broad selloff; it was a rotation back toward infrastructure. Application had been the strongest layer since October, gaining 8% while Compute lagged. This week marked Compute's third consecutive week of leadership.

The concentration pattern confirms the rotation story. The top 5 contributors posted gains while the rest of the index lost ground — an inverted week where leadership and the broader market moved in opposite directions. Bubble pressure remains moderate across all layers, though Application shows the highest valuation acceleration, suggesting expectations there may have run ahead of the pullback.
