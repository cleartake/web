**Bubble narratives tend to focus on financing structures, while market conditions are harder to observe.**

The reality is more layered than that.

This ClearTake analysis brings together CEO narratives from CES 2026, quarterly earnings data, and a value-chain lens to examine the distinction between circular investment flows and genuine supply–demand constraints — and to locate where risk is actually building across the AI stack.

## The Claim Everyone Is Making

A growing chorus of analysts and investors has converged on a compelling critique of AI infrastructure spending.

The argument runs like this: Hyperscalers buy GPUs. GPU makers reinvest in AI companies. Those AI companies use the capital to buy more GPUs. The money chases itself, and when the music stops, we'll discover there was never any real end demand—just financial reflexivity dressed up as progress.

Michael Burry, the investor who famously shorted the 2008 housing market, has been one of the most vocal critics of the current AI boom, arguing that NVIDIA now plays a role similar to Cisco’s during the 1999–2000 bubble. In recent posts he warned that “the future will regard this a picture of fraud, not a flywheel,” adding that “true end demand is ridiculously small” and that “almost all customers are funded by their dealers.” Building on a widely shared Bloomberg visual of the “AI money loop,” subsequent coverage has described these arrangements as “circular deals,” where chipmakers, cloud operators, and AI platforms invest in and buy from one another in ways that help support each other’s spending and valuations.

This is a serious argument, and it deserves to be taken seriously. But it also deserves to be tested against what the companies actually building this infrastructure are saying—and what their financial results show.

## What the CEOs Are Actually Saying

At CES 2026, within hours of each other, the CEOs of both major GPU companies addressed packed audiences in Las Vegas. Their message was strikingly consistent—and strikingly at odds with the circular investment narrative.

**Jensen Huang, NVIDIA:**

> "People ask, 'Where is the money coming from?' The modernization of computing to AI, the shifting of R&D budgets from classical methods to now artificial intelligence methods... which explains why we're so busy."

When discussing compute markets: "Cloud GPUs are sold out." The announcement of Vera Rubin, NVIDIA's next-generation platform, was explicitly positioned as a response to demand that existing capacity cannot meet. Huang explained why NVIDIA had to redesign six chips simultaneously rather than the typical one or two: Moore's Law has slowed to 1.6x transistor growth per year, while model sizes grow 10x annually.

This is not the language of a company trying to create demand. It's the language of a company racing to avoid becoming the bottleneck.

**Lisa Su, AMD:**

> "We have seen a huge surge in demand... growing from about one Zettaflop in 2022 to more than a hundred Zettaflops in 2025. But what you're going to hear tonight from everyone is we don't have nearly enough compute for everything that we can possibly do."

Greg Brockman, President of OpenAI, reinforced the constraint narrative from AMD's stage: "Every time we want to release a new feature... we have a big fight internally over compute, because there are so many things we want to launch that we simply cannot, because we are compute constrained."

When two direct competitors describe the same market the same way—as demand-constrained and undersupplied—the signal is worth noting. If this were a classic bubble, the story would be about excess capacity. Instead, both CEOs describe a race to deliver compute that customers need but cannot get.

## Where the Bubble Story Breaks

The circular investment argument has a structural weakness: circularity in infrastructure buildouts is normal.

Railways in the 19th century exhibited exactly this pattern. Steel companies supplied rails. Railways bought steel. Both invested in each other's growth. The same dynamic played out with electricity and the early internet. In each case, critics pointed to circular capital flows as evidence of speculation. And in each case, they were partially right—there were excesses that eventually corrected. But the underlying infrastructure was real.

The question was never whether the money was circular. It was whether the output was constrained or surplus.

**Bubbles form when capital creates more capacity than reality can absorb.** The telecom bust happened because companies built far more fiber optic capacity than demand could fill. The housing bubble burst because housing stock exceeded qualified buyers.

The AI compute market is defined by the opposite problem. Every major customer reports they cannot get enough. Capacity expansions are pre-sold. Wait times stretch months or years.

One sentence that matters: **Circular investment is a financing structure. Constraint vs. surplus is a market condition. The bubble thesis conflates the two.**

## ClearTake's View: Where the Risk Actually Lives

Our layer analysis suggests the circular investment narrative gets the location of risk wrong while asking a valid question about sustainability.

The AI Value Chain split sharply in the first week of 2026. Compute jumped 3.8% while Platform fell 2.3% and Application dropped 3.2%—the widest layer divergence since early April. This wasn't a broad selloff; it was a rotation back toward infrastructure.

The Bubble Index readings tell a consistent story. As of January 4, 2026:

- **Compute: 0.31** — Normal regime. Valuations aligned with fundamentals.
- **Platform: 0.36** — Warming, but contained.
- **Application: 0.45** — Approaching elevated territory. The highest valuation acceleration (0.72) of any layer.

The aggregate sits at 0.37—warming, but far from the 0.70+ levels that signal genuine speculative excess.

The Compute layer shows no sign of speculative oversupply. The risk, to the extent it exists, is elsewhere:

**At the Application layer**, enterprises are deploying AI in pilots that may or may not generate returns. Our data shows Application with the highest valuation acceleration—expectations running ahead of fundamentals. This is worth monitoring.

**At the Platform layer**, some AI model companies have valuations assuming revenue trajectories they may not achieve. The capability is real, but monetization at scale remains unproven.

The financials confirm the constraint story. NVIDIA maintains mid-70s gross margins quarter after quarter—pricing power that only exists when supply is constrained. AMD's multi-year, multi-gigawatt commitment from OpenAI (with warrants that could give OpenAI up to ~10% of AMD if fully exercised) represents exactly the kind of long-dated capacity lock-up that doesn't happen in speculative markets.

## The Translation Problem

The circular investment critics are asking the right question: **Is this sustainable?** But they're answering it by looking at financing structures rather than market conditions.

What the compute layer shows is simpler: more compute is being consumed than produced, prices remain elevated, and every major capacity expansion is absorbed before it arrives. These are not bubble signatures. They're signatures of genuine constraint meeting genuine demand.

**The risk isn't that "AI is fake."** The risk is mispricing timing, layers, and expectations. Some applications will overpromise. Some platforms will outrun adoption. Some investors will extrapolate trends that don't hold.

But that's not a compute bubble. That's a translation problem between capability and monetization—and it plays out differently at different layers of the value chain.


## Why the Bubble Narrative Makes Sense to Sophisticated Investors

It’s worth addressing a reasonable question: if the distinction between circular financing and market constraint is so central, why do many sophisticated analysts and investors continue to frame AI infrastructure spending as a bubble?

The answer is that, under several well-established analytical lenses, the bubble narrative is not irrational. In fact, it is often internally consistent, historically grounded, and aligned with the incentives these actors face.

First, **the narrative aligns with pattern recognition that has worked before**. Capital-intensive technology buildouts have repeatedly followed a similar arc: optimistic projections, aggressive financing, interdependent investment loops, and eventual overcapacity. Telecom infrastructure in the late 1990s, solar manufacturing in the 2010s, and more recently crypto infrastructure all exhibited circular funding structures alongside compelling technological stories. For analysts trained to recognize recurring market shapes, the current AI investment web looks familiar. Seeing a familiar structure, it is rational to anticipate a familiar outcome.

Second, **circular financing is a legitimate red flag in many historical cases**. When suppliers fund customers who then become the primary source of demand, it has often preceded demand shortfalls. Analysts are right to scrutinize these arrangements because they can obscure whether end demand is independent or subsidized. The fact that such scrutiny is happening reflects discipline, not ignorance.

Third, **valuation and timing matter more than absolute demand in many investment strategies**. Shorting or underweighting a company like NVIDIA is rarely a statement that AI is meaningless. It is more often a statement about expectations embedded in price. NVIDIA sits at the narrowest choke point of the AI value chain and captures an extraordinary share of economic value. That makes it highly sensitive to any deceleration in growth, margin normalization, or capital-spending pauses. From a portfolio perspective, expressing caution through the most exposed node in the system is rational.

Fourth, **financing structures are far more visible than operational constraints**. Capital flows, equity stakes, and partnership announcements are legible, diagrammable, and headline-friendly. Physical and operational constraints—manufacturing lead times, yield limits, power availability, network bottlenecks—are slower, quieter, and harder to model from the outside. Analysts operating at macro scale naturally overweight what can be observed cleanly and updated frequently.

Finally, **markets reward anticipation of sentiment shifts as much as long-term correctness**. Many strategies are optimized for volatility, multiple compression, or narrative inflection points rather than for diagnosing the steady-state of an industry years out. In that context, emphasizing circularity is not necessarily a claim about eventual demand collapse; it is a way to express concern about sustainability on a given time horizon.

Seen through this lens, the bubble narrative is not the product of naïveté. It reflects a coherent interpretation of visible signals, historical analogies, and incentive structures.

ClearTake’s contribution is not to dismiss that interpretation, but to narrow the diagnostic question. Financing structures explain how capacity is funded. Market conditions determine whether capacity is excessive or scarce. When those two are conflated, conclusions about bubbles can arrive too early—or in the wrong layer of the system.

The disagreement, then, is not about whether risks exist. It is about where they reside, and which signals are most relevant for identifying them.
