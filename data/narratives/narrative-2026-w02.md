title: Week 02, 2026 – Compute Extends Its Lead as the Rotation Holds
---

The infrastructure rotation continued. Compute gained another 2.2% while Platform and Application both posted modest losses — extending the pattern that began at the turn of the year. This marks Compute's fourth consecutive week of layer leadership, its longest streak since the April selloff recovery.

The divergence is now structural. Since late December, Compute has climbed 6.1% while Platform has fallen 2.9% and Application has dropped 3.9%. The widest single-week spread came in Week 01 at 7 percentage points; Week 02 moderated to 3 points but kept the same directional signature.

Concentration remains elevated. The top 5 contributors accounted for roughly double the aggregate return — posting positive gains while the rest of the index lost ground. This is the second consecutive week where leadership and the broader market moved in opposite directions, suggesting the rotation is being driven by a narrow set of names rather than broad layer strength.

Bubble conditions are stable. The aggregate sits at 0.36 — warming but contained. Compute reads 0.28 (normal), Platform 0.40 (warming), and Application 0.39 (warming). Platform shows the highest valuation acceleration at 0.55, while Application carries the strongest price momentum at 0.42. Neither is flashing elevated readings, but the gap between layer performance and bubble signals bears watching: Compute is leading in returns while registering the lowest speculative pressure.

The story remains the same as previous week — capital rotating back toward infrastructure — but this week confirms it wasn't a one-week anomaly. Whether this reflects renewed confidence in the compute buildout or simply Application profit-taking after its Q4 run, the market is voting for picks and shovels over productivity software.
